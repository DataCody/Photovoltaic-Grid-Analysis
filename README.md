# ‚òÄÔ∏è Photovoltaic-Grid-Analysis

## üìò Project Overview

This project analyzes photovoltaic (solar) energy production data, focusing on metrics such as AC/DC power generation, energy efficiency, temperature effects, and revenue trends over time. The interactive dashboard is built using Power BI and showcases insights using sample data to simulate real-world solar grid scenarios.

## üóÇÔ∏è About the Dataset

This project combines two complementary data sources to explore solar photovoltaic system performance and market-driven outcomes in diverse environments.

### 1. üåû Solar Generation Data (Kaggle)

- **Source**: [Solar Data from Diverse Regions (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/examsgovt/solar-data-from-diverse-regions)
- **Scope**: Hourly solar power generation data from **four countries** (Australia, Brazil, India, and Norway) representing distinct climatic zones throughout the **full year of 2024**.
- **Key Variables**:
  - `DC_Power` and `AC_Power`: Raw and inverter output power measurements (kW)
  - `Module_Temperature` and `Ambient_Temperature`: Temperature readings in ¬∞C
  - `Irradiance`: Solar irradiance (W/m¬≤)
  - `Daily_Yield`, `Cumulative_Yield`: Energy generation performance (kWh)
  - `Timestamp`: 1-hour interval time series

This dataset enables detailed analysis of **solar performance across geographic, seasonal, and environmental factors**. It is suitable for time series modeling, PV system efficiency studies, and climate-resilient energy planning.

### 2. ‚ö° Electricity Market Data (OpenNEM API)

- **Source**: OpenNEM REST API
- **Scope**: Australian electricity market data (2024, hourly resolution)
- **Key Variables**:
  - `Price`: Market electricity price (AUD/MWh)
  - `Demand`: Electricity demand (MW)
  - `Energy_Demanded`: Actual energy supplied (MWh)

By integrating market data with generation data, this project provides a foundation for analyzing **solar revenue potential**, **supply-demand dynamics**, and the **economic viability of PV systems** under varying grid conditions.

- **Daily Yield (kWh)**: Total energy generated each day.
- **Cumulative Yield (kWh)**: Aggregated energy production over time.

### üå°Ô∏è Environmental & Operational Conditions
- **Module Temperature (¬∞C)**: Actual temperature of the solar panel modules.
- **Ambient Temperature (¬∞C)**: Surrounding environmental temperature, influencing efficiency.
- **Solar Irradiance (W/m¬≤)**: Intensity of sunlight received, a direct driver of energy production.
- **Temperature vs. Efficiency Curve**: Insights into how heat affects system performance.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Temporal Dimensions
- **Hourly Profiles**: Captures intra-day performance patterns (morning peak, noon plateau, evening drop).
- **Daily/Monthly Trends**: Seasonal variations in power generation and environmental factors.
- **Time-of-Day Analysis**: Identifies high-efficiency and low-yield periods.

### ‚ö° Electricity Market & Economic Indicators
- **Market Price (AUD/MWh)**: Dynamic electricity pricing data from OpenNEM.

## üìä Data-Driven Insights (Preliminary)

Based on the current sample data and dashboard visualization, the following preliminary insights can be observed:

- **Power Generation Trends:** The photovoltaic system shows a clear daily and seasonal pattern in AC and DC power outputs, with peak generation typically occurring during midday hours.
- **Efficiency Variations:** Calculated system efficiency (AC power divided by DC power) fluctuates throughout the day, often decreasing during high ambient temperatures, indicating thermal impacts on inverter performance.
- **Temperature Effects:** There is a noticeable negative correlation between module temperature and power output, suggesting that higher temperatures may reduce photovoltaic efficiency.
- **Revenue Estimation:** Revenue correlates closely with power generation patterns, highlighting the financial impact of environmental conditions and system performance.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Preliminary observations suggest occasional dips in power output that may be linked to transient weather conditions or equipment issues, warranting further investigation.

These insights will be refined and expanded as more data is analyzed and additional features are incorporated into the dashboard.
